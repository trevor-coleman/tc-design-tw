[Earth Tech](https://climateventures.org/earthtech/) is a six-month accelerator 
program for CleanTech Startups offered by the [Centre for Social Innovation](https://socialinnovation.org/). As an 
Entrepreneur-in-Residence I am the lead advisor for a group of founders in

businesses investment-ready.
