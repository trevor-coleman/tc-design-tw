Come Bye is a casual sheepdog simulation game. Playing as a shepherd you whistle 
commands to your sheepdog, herding your flock through gates and around obstacles.

I started working on the project after seeing a Sheepdog demonstration at the 
Royal Winter Agricultural Fair. The game uses the same commands that real 
shepherds use to work with dogs.

I'm building the game in Unity3D (C#) and there have been some interesting coding 
challenges along the way. For instance the pathing alogorithm that the dog uses 
to circle the sheep is fairly complex as the shape and size of the flock are 
dynamic.

Another interesting challenge was developing the sheep behaviour that incorporates
a boids-inspired flocking behaviour with a fear mechanic that allows the dog and 
shepherd to drive them.

While the release date is TBD, you can [wishlist the game on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1282380/Come_Bye_A_Sheepdog_Simulator/) to be 
notified when it goes on sale.
