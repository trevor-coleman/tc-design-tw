Each year I facilitate a design exercise for a syndicate of  graduating students
in the [Joint Command and Staff Programme](https://www.cfc.forces.gc.ca/226-eng.html). As facilitator, I lead the team through
a design sprint where the students tackle a design challenge rooted in the 
complex, dynamic global context in which the forces operate.
