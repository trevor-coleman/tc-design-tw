Each year I facilitate a design exercise for a syndicate of  graduating students
in the [Joint Command and Staff Programme](https://www.cfc.forces.gc.ca/226-eng.html). As facilitator, I lead the team through
a design sprint.

Over the course of ten days, the students tackle a design challenge rooted
in the complex, dynamic global context in which the forces operate.

Topics have ranged from humanitarian interventions in West Africa to NATO
involvement in Post-Soviet Europe.
